## 🏠 Overview of the RNB project

-- This project is designed to provide a scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payment systems. It enables customers to easily discover and book their preferred hostels based on availability, location, and property type. Whether users are looking to rent or purchase, the platform ensures a smooth experience by offering relevant options tailored to their preferences.

## Project Goals of the RNB 

-- User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
-- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
-- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
-- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
-- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
-- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technology Stack

🐍 Django
Purpose:
Django serves as the core backend framework, powering the main application logic.

Handles routing, authentication, and user management.

Manages the interaction between the API and the database.

Provides built-in admin and ORM features for faster development.

🔌 Django REST Framework (DRF)
Purpose:
Used to build RESTful APIs that enable frontend clients (like React or mobile apps) to interact with backend data.

Handles serialization of data (e.g., converting model instances into JSON).

Provides authentication, permissions, and throttling for API access.

Simplifies CRUD operations for models like User, Listing, and Booking.

🛢️ PostgreSQL
Purpose:
Acts as the primary database for storing structured data such as:

User accounts and profiles

Listings, bookings, payments, reviews

Relationships between different entities (e.g., a user can have many bookings)

🧠 GraphQL
Purpose:
Optional or complementary to REST, GraphQL provides a flexible query language to fetch exactly the data the client needs.

Reduces over-fetching/under-fetching compared to REST.

Useful for dynamic frontends that need tailored data structures.

Can live alongside REST endpoints in the same Django project.

🕒 Celery
Purpose:
Used to run background tasks asynchronously, improving performance and user experience.
Examples:

Sending booking confirmation emails

Processing payments or invoices

Scheduling reminders or notifications

⚡ Redis
Purpose:
Acts as a message broker for Celery, and is also used for:

Caching frequently used data (like listings)

Session management and storing user sessions

Reducing load on the database

📦 Docker
Purpose:
Provides containerization, allowing the project to run in isolated, reproducible environments.

Ensures the same configuration works on all developer machines and servers

Simplifies deployment by packaging the app, database, and services together

Makes testing, scaling, and continuous deployment easier

🔁 CI/CD Pipelines
Purpose:
Used to automatically test, build, and deploy code changes, improving code quality and development speed.

Run tests on every push (e.g., unit tests, lint checks)

Deploy updates to staging or production environments automatically

Can be set up using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.
