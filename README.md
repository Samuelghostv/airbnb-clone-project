## Technology Stack

🐍 Django
Purpose:
Django serves as the core backend framework, powering the main application logic.

Handles routing, authentication, and user management.

Manages the interaction between the API and the database.

Provides built-in admin and ORM features for faster development.

🔌 Django REST Framework (DRF)
Purpose:
Used to build RESTful APIs that enable frontend clients (like React or mobile apps) to interact with backend data.

Handles serialization of data (e.g., converting model instances into JSON).

Provides authentication, permissions, and throttling for API access.

Simplifies CRUD operations for models like User, Listing, and Booking.

🛢️ PostgreSQL
Purpose:
Acts as the primary database for storing structured data such as:

User accounts and profiles

Listings, bookings, payments, reviews

Relationships between different entities (e.g., a user can have many bookings)

🧠 GraphQL
Purpose:
Optional or complementary to REST, GraphQL provides a flexible query language to fetch exactly the data the client needs.

Reduces over-fetching/under-fetching compared to REST.

Useful for dynamic frontends that need tailored data structures.

Can live alongside REST endpoints in the same Django project.

🕒 Celery
Purpose:
Used to run background tasks asynchronously, improving performance and user experience.
Examples:

Sending booking confirmation emails

Processing payments or invoices

Scheduling reminders or notifications

⚡ Redis
Purpose:
Acts as a message broker for Celery, and is also used for:

Caching frequently used data (like listings)

Session management and storing user sessions

Reducing load on the database

📦 Docker
Purpose:
Provides containerization, allowing the project to run in isolated, reproducible environments.

Ensures the same configuration works on all developer machines and servers

Simplifies deployment by packaging the app, database, and services together

Makes testing, scaling, and continuous deployment easier

🔁 CI/CD Pipelines
Purpose:
Used to automatically test, build, and deploy code changes, improving code quality and development speed.

Run tests on every push (e.g., unit tests, lint checks)

Deploy updates to staging or production environments automatically

Can be set up using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.

## 🔐 API Security


1.Authentication
What It Is:
Verifies a user's identity before granting access.

How to Implement:

Use secure login with hashed passwords (e.g., Django's PBKDF2).

Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication.

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) (optional but recommended).

Why It's Crucial:

Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts.

Protects sensitive information like bookings and payment history.

2.Authorization
What It Is:
Ensures users can only access resources they’re allowed to.

How to Implement:

Role-based access control (RBAC): guests vs. hosts vs. admin.

Use Django permissions or custom decorators for API access.

Why It's Crucial:

Prevents users from modifying others' listings, bookings, or payments.

Enforces data ownership and privacy.

3.Rate Limiting
What It Is:
Limits the number of requests a client can make in a given time.

How to Implement:

Use Django REST Framework throttling or tools like django-ratelimit.

Apply stricter limits on authentication and payment endpoints.

Why It's Crucial:

Protects against brute-force attacks and abuse of APIs.

Preserves server performance.

4.Input Validation & Sanitization
What It Is:
Ensures all user input is clean, expected, and safe.

How to Implement:

Validate all form fields, query params, and API inputs.

Use serializers in DRF for clean data.

Escape output in frontend templates to prevent XSS.

Why It's Crucial:

Prevents attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and command injection.

5.SRF Protection
What It Is:
Prevents malicious sites from making requests on behalf of a logged-in user.

How to Implement:

Use Django's built-in CSRF middleware.

Apply CSRF tokens in forms and AJAX requests.

Why It's Crucial:

Protects authenticated users from unintentional harmful actions.

6.Secure Payments
What It Is:
Protects financial transactions and data.

How to Implement:

Use a trusted third-party payment provider (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).

Ensure HTTPS for all payment interactions.

Do not store card data — delegate to the payment provider.

Why It's Crucial:

Protects against fraud and legal liability.

Builds trust with users who enter sensitive payment data.

7.HTTPS and SSL
What It Is:
Encrypts communication between the client and server.

How to Implement:

Use HTTPS via SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt).

Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

Why It's Crucial:

Prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

8.Logging & Monitoring
What It Is:
Tracks system activity and detects anomalies.

How to Implement:

Log failed login attempts, suspicious activity, and payment errors.

Use monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) for alerts.

Why It's Crucial:

Helps detect and respond to breaches quickly.

Aids in debugging and forensic analysis.

9.Data Encryption
What It Is:
Protects sensitive data at rest and in transit.

How to Implement:

Use database encryption for fields like personal details.

Store hashed passwords, never plain text.

Encrypt data before storing in Redis or logs if sensitive.
